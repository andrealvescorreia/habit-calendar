# About
Sometimes creating new habits can be hard, so it's important to record your progress.
With Habit Calendar you can mark a day in green, symbolizing that you have accomplished the daily task that you want to make it a habit. If not, mark it as red.
At the end of the month, you will have the percentage of success of your habit. The main goal is for you to always reach a new *'high score'*, symbolizing your **self improvement**.

*"A habit cannot be tossed out the window; it must be coaxed down the stairs a step at a time"* - Mark Twain
